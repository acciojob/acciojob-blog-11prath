            <p>We can say that optimization is the process of minimizing or maximizing an expression, based on the requirement of the problem. It allows us to come up with an efficient algorithm that helps us to save space and time complexity for a given program. Sometimes, a problem is solvable by using a brute-force approach, but it may have a high time complexity. In such a situation, we optimize the code to reduce the complexity and make the code run faster.</p>
